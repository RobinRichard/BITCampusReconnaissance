# BITCampusReconnaissance

This project aims to provide a user-friendly mobile application to digitize the traditional way of filling forms using pen and paper. Every year BIT asks the newly enrolled students to fill a
paper form containing questions about the polytechnic campus. The objective of this form is
to make sure that every student knows all the important information about the campus.
I developed a mobile application which makes the students to fill the same form in digital
format. Anyone can easily download the mobile application and register with their email
address and can fill the Reconnaissance form easily.
There are two different parts in this project â€“ a web application and a mobile application.

##1. Web application
Using this application, the administrator can add questions for the
reconnaissance form and can generate the reports in PDF format that contains all the
submitted responses of the students for those questions. This web application also
provides APIs for the mobile application for accessing data relevant to the user in the
database.
##2. Mobile application 
This is the application that will be used by the Polytechnic
students. It fetches the questions from the database using the APIs provided by the
web application and displays them in a well-designed user interface screen of the
mobile application. The students provide answers to these questions which are
recorded in the database.
